COURIER SERVICE APPLICATION DETAILS FOR DEVELOPMENT

Project name: Deliveco
This is a delivery web application for transporting cargo, parcels or goods to
customers. Customers should oversee parcel packaging. Deliveco will offer
parcel transport and secure storage depots for the delivery process from city to
